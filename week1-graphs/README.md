## Why this course?
  * Background on "The Nature of Code"
  * Not an AI course.
  * Not a Machine Learning course.
  * Not a Deep Learning course.
  * Not an art course.
  * Not a science course.
  * What's left?
  * How can we capture the magic and wonder of "intelligence" and "learning" in software?
  * Is there a difference between software that is intelligent and software that "appears" intelligent?
  * The algorithms and math around this stuff are scary and impenetrable.
  * Can we learn this together?
  * What creative experiments can you make?
  * Can we make the world a better place?

## Structure / Overview
  * "Research" presentations

## What is Artificial Intelligence?
  * "Models for Thinking, Perception, Action" -- Patrick Winston, MIT, [Artificial Intelligence, MIT Open CourseWare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjZBTDzGeGg&index=1&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi)
  * "many things can be AI, including simple programming. AI is the automation of thought" [@fchollet](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/843617373584310273?refsrc=email&s=11)
  * [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://amzn.to/2nsuIph)

## What is Machine Learning?
  * Data analysis
  * Data --> Meaning
  * Types of Machine Learning
    * Rule-based Systems
    * Supervised Learning
      * Classification, Regression
    * Unsupervised Learning
      * Clustering
    * Reinforcement Learning
    * Generative output

## What is Deep Learning
  * Machine learning with "deep" neural networks.
  * Deep meaning "many layers" deep.

## Ok, what about Artificial General Intelligence?
  * DeepMind and Q-Learning
