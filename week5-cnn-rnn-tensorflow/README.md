* Steps
  1. Convolution, see: [Convolution Matrix](https://docs.gimp.org/en/plug-in-convmatrix.html) from GIMP documentation.
  2. ReLU (aka "Rectified Linear Unit"): A non-linear activation function that turns all negative values into zero.
  3. Pooling: reduces the resolution / dimensionality of each feature map generated by the convolution. (see "equivarient" below).
  4. Classification (Fully-Connected Network)

## Terminology
  * [filter (aka kernel)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)
  * feature map
  * equivarient: refers to the scale independent nature of the features, allowing objects to be detected in the image at any size / location.
  * [softmax](http://cs231n.github.io/linear-classify/#softmax): an activation function for the final output layer that squashes all values to between 0 and 1 (and adding up to 1). This is perfect for probabilistic outputs like image classifcation.

## CNN Parameters
* filter size
* depth: number of filters per convolution layer
* stride: number of pixels the filter "sliders over" (i.e. are any pixels skipped to reduce)
