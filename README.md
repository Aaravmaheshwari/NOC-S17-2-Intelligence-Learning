The Nature of Code Part 2 (Spring 2017)
======================================

Syllabus for Part 2 of Nature of Code: "Intelligence and Learning" at ITP Spring 2017

This syllabus is very much in progress. I'm drawing inspiration from this [Coding Train community list of resources](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Machine-Learning).
