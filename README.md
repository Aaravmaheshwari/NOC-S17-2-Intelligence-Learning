The Nature of Code Part 2 (Spring 2017)
======================================

Syllabus for Part 2 of Nature of Code: "Intelligence and Learning" at ITP Spring 2017

This syllabus is very much in progress. I'm drawing inspiration from this [Coding Train community list of resources](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Machine-Learning).

Class Info
----------
* Daniel Shiffman: daniel.shiffman@nyu.edu
* Section 1: Tuesdays, 9:00-11:30am
* Section 2: Wednesdays, 9:00-11:30am
* [Office Hours](https://itp.nyu.edu/inwiki/Signup/Shiffman)
* [Sign up for Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/a/itp.nyu.edu/forum/#!forum/natureofcode)
* [Resources and References](https://github.com/shiffman/NOC-S17-2-Intelligence-Learning/wiki/References-Resources)

Prerequisites?
-------------
* Basic familiary with [p5.js](http://p5js.org) and [Processing](http://processing.org).
* Fundamentals of computer programming, equivalent to [ICM](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2016)
* While taking [Nature of Code Part 1](https://github.com/shiffman/NOC-S17-1-Physics-Animation) is not required, I recommend you familiarize yourself with the following chapters before the first day of class.
  * [Chapter 1: Vectors](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-1-vectors)
  * [Chapter 2: Forces](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-2-forces)
  * [Chapter 3: Oscillation and Trig](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-3-oscillation)
  * [Chapter 6: Steering Behaviors](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents)
* I assume no knowledge whatsoever about AI, machine learning, deep learning and the accompanying math required for the algorithms listed below. After all, I barely know this stuff myself. 

Week 1 - Introduction (March 21/22)
-------------------------------
* Class Intro / Overview
* Algorithms
  * Big O notation
  * Graphs
     * [Binary Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)

     * [Dijktra's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm)
     * [A\* search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm)
     * [Traveling Salesperson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)
     * plus steering agents!

Week 2 - Genetic Algorithms (March 28/29) 
---------------------------

* Steering agents

Week 7 - Project Presentations (May 2/3)
------------------------------

Policies
-----------------------------------------------
* Submit assignments by the evening before class to the extent possible.
* Come prepared with questions.
* Put away screens during others' presentations.
* Participate!
* Document!
* Grading:
   * 40% Class Participation
   * 40% Quality of assignments
   * 20% Final project
* For a 2-point class, 2 or more unexcused absences is grounds for failure.
