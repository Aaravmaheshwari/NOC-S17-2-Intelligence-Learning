# Neural Networks

## History
* In 1943, Warren S. McCulloch, a neuroscientist, and Walter Pitts, a logician, developed the first conceptual model of an artificial neural network. In their paper, "[A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5272/8a99829792c3272043842455f3a110e841b1.pdf),” they describe the concept of a neuron, a single cell living in a network of cells that receives inputs, processes those inputs, and generates an output.
* Invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory ([original paper](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/courses/cogs501/Rosenblatt1958.pdf)), a perceptron is the simplest neural network possible: a computational model of a single neuron. A perceptron consists of one or more inputs, a processor, and a single output.
